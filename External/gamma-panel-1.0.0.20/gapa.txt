Gamma Panel is a little & handy application that lets you adjust
brightness, contrast and gamma settings in real-time. Thanks to its hot-key
feature, you don't even have to leave the game you're playing! The program
works pretty similar to Color profiles in PowerStrip but is completely free
and much smaller in terms of system load and memory usage.

The program is pretty simple - it just sits on the taskbar and does its
job. You can apply profiles in 2 ways: by pressing assigned hot-key
combination or by selecting the entry from the popup menu. The last
selected color profile is automatically applied on the next program run.

The profiles can be added, modified or removed in the main window
(click on the tray icon and select Settings to open it). The controls are
pretty self-explanatory. LUT is the maximum possible number of different
colors that can be reproduced. The largest number is 16'777'216 so you can
see the loss in color resolution when applying any correction.

Important note:
Pressing Esc key resets the display controls to their default position - it
might be very useful if you set the brightness too high or too low and you
don't see anything.

All the settings and profiles are stored in gapa.ini file so you don't need
to have administrator rights to run or install the program (it doesn't
write anything to the registry). The .ini file is saved in the current
working directory so you can use as many configuration files as you wish.
Just change the working directory in the shortcut and the program will read
and write its settings to a different file.

The program has been tested and found to be working without any problems
with:
- Microsoft Windows 98SE
- Microsoft Windows XP

It uses only standard Win32-API calls so it should work well with any other
version of Windows. Let me know if you encounter any problems - I'll try to
fix it as soon as possible.
