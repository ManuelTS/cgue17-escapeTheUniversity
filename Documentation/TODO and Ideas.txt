Skymap, with a beautiful night sky von NASA deep field image full of stars in OGLSB as cube map on page 640. Before doing that check "seamless cube map / sky box2".

Fade for sound

in the gBuffer try to reduce the single GL_** bit attachments from GL_DEPTH32F_STENCIL8 to GL_DEPTH24F_STENCIL8 for example

DONE: Rim lighting openGL super Bibile page 634, but only if object is lit from the back, now only use it

Textures (Stefan):

University interriors,
- Furnitures, books, bookshelfs, pc, monitors, bakets
- Name tags / signs on doors, conspiracy wirtings on the toiled
- Plants
- Pictures and graffitty on the walls, but only few
- lecture hall, black board, projector, overhead projector, chairs
- laterns
- All those elements everywhere to make the university realistic

Infunctional elevator, from the basement up to to roof top, must be with typical elevator music.

Ideas (both):

Perspective Room from https://youtu.be/xleyq2oJt_8?t=30m53s as art installation in a room with a sign beside the door which says "There is only a perspective seeing, only a perspective "knowing"". - Friedrich Nietzsche 1844 - 1900

Generator which changes physics, negative gravity?...

If a charater is camping giv an NPC the position and let him walk to that position to detect him

Link the sound to the view frustum culling, if outside the cull it is decreased

Austiran tradition, insert a basement, optional a parkinglot too, maybe combine it with "fatal decisions".

Fatal decisions During sneaking dark secrets of the university can be discovered, e.g. the player puts the hand in a hole (safe or vault) after entering a code, but it gets chopped of if entered wrong. Best in the cellar in combination with "austrian tradition".

Time doors, you have to sneak fast otherwise the door(s) will close.

Cars, let it shake as if someone has sex in it, with sound.

Laser laboratorium, a room contains a laiser with a sign "do not look with the remaining eye in the laiser" and a blind professor in it with extended hearing capabilities.

Octopus, put somewhere a big fucking octopus from a professor who's experiment went wrong, or at least its arms.

Cloning, a gun, box, room, crazy person, or whatsoever which allows you to clone things.

Roof revision:
- roof with stairs up to it and door on top
- handrails to not to fall down
- roofgarden

Gras, done with a single, perfect culm as in the openGL SB. Use instanced drawing 294, draw many objects with a single function call gldraw***instanced(); On page 305 is good simple instanced example. Either transform feedback or compute shader usage is a must, look into the OGLSB.
