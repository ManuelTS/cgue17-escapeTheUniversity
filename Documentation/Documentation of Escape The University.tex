\section{Development Status and Bugs}
We will try to get rid of all bugs before the 28.06.2017!
\begin{itemize}
\item Bullet buggy since openGL world and bullet world are asynchronous in their positions.
\item Hence for now only partiality collision detection
\item Inside a light volume everything is culled, no light volumnes in use.
\item Not much gameplay because the effect point implementations took so much time.
\end{itemize}

\section{Controls \label{Controls}}

\begin{table}[h!]

\section{Implemented Effect Points}
\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \label{effectsTable}
  \begin{tabular}{l|p{10cm}|l}
    \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Value}\\ \hline
      Vertex skinning & A complete bone structure is loaded from a model file and assigned to the model according to weighted indices. The skinning is done on the GPU. & 2	\\ \hline
      Deferred Shading & 	Use the Deferred Shading technique to speed up lighting for many light sources. It uses several render targets and processes light information (shadows etc) in a post process effect (decoupling it from the scenes geometry). Transparency, however, is more difficult to handle & 1\\ \hline
      Shadow Maps (with PCF) & 	As presented in the lectures, shadow maps calculate the shadows via rendering the scene from the light source. PCF samples the shadow map several times to improve quality. Make sure to counter all artifacts. & 1.5\\ \hline
      \textbf{Summary} & \textbf{-} & \textbf{4.5}\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
For implementation references and explanation see section \ref{features}.



\section{Gameplay}
You find yourself in the middle of an university room. You need to get out of the building without being detected. Open the doors and find yourself a way towards the paved floor. Do not open the wrong door, otherwise you encounter a professor and you are busted!
This is just a trial run... consider yourself planning your escape for the real experience that will follow. Explore the building, get the floor plane into your head. It will help your real escape in the near future.


\section{Camera}
The free moving camera is implemented as on the \href{http://www.learnopengl.com/#!Getting-started/Camera}{tutorial on camera from learnOpenGL.com} with slight modification to suit our needs, e.g. scroll speed, include all depth values on movement etc.

\section{Moving Objects}
\begin{itemize}
\item Opening and closing doors.
\item Moving character animated with vertex skinning.
\item Chairs
\end{itemize}

\section{Texture Mapping}
\begin{itemize}
\item Door + door handle + doorframe
\item Lamps and switches
\item Table + chairs + Posters + book (shelfs)
\item Trashbin, student work bench
\item Character
\item Whole building
\item Paved pathwalk outside the building
\end{itemize}

\section{Simple Lighting and Materials}


\subsection{Light Sources \label{lightSources}}
All objects are now illuminated with blinn phong lighting from a \href{http://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/Advanced-Lighting}{blinn phong tutorial on learnOpenGL.com}. Deferred shading form \cite{openGLSuperBible}, \href{http://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/Deferred-Shading}{learnopengl.com deferred shaing tutorial}, and \href{http://www.lighthouse3d.com/tutorials/opengl_framebuffer_objects/}{lighthouse3d.com openGL framebuffer objects}.
Point lights done with the \href{http://learnopengl.com/#!Lighting/Light-casters}{light casters tutorial on learnOpenGL.com}. There are currently 10 light-sources in use, distributed among the playfield.


\subsection{Textures and Blender Models}

For creating and as well as modifying our objects, we used Blender 2.78c freely available from \url{https://www.blender.org/features/2-78/}. All objects (except Animated Female Cyborg)have been reviewed for minimized triangle count. The game contains 156 objects, containing 209.312 triangles (according to Blender).

\begin{itemize}

\item If not explicit declared otherwise, textures have been taken from
\url{https://lva.cg.tuwien.ac.at/textures/} or painted by ourself (single color textures mostly).

\item The garden table model as well as its textures have been taken from the freely available download-package (after sign-up with email) from the website
\url{http://www.chocofur.com/}. It has been modified in order to have the correct display behaviour in OpenGL as well as a reduced triangle load.

\item The textures for the doors \& door frames are also from the previously mentioned download package. The model was designed by ourselves.
