Shit in VS 13:
- Shortcuts nicht exportierbar, keine eigene Shortcutprofilerstellung
- Serach next (F3) & and replace next (alt + R) have completley unrelated shortcuts
- Shortcut characters are not underlined
- Refresh folder structure with standard short cut F5 or right click impossible, weak HCI
- Simple Copy & Paste in the Solution Explorer impossible
- Adding a new file in the folder structure, refresh, clean, rebuild do not show the new added file, a restart of VS does it
- Special and blank characters are ignored on Ctrl + Shift + Arrow Key
- No recent opend list
- All this with 8 GB disc space

Shit in VS 15:
- VS 15 had no clear statement to find on google about the new project structure
- In the build events the "inherit from parent or project defaults" the entered content
