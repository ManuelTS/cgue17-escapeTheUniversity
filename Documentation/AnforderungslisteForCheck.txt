		[ ] Source Code
			 Upload the zip archive to this TUWEL course with the name "source1-[groupname]"
			 Download ZIP from github
		[ ] Executeable

			Don't include any source files or any unnecessary intermediate files such as Visual Studio databases, solutions, etc. Just think of this submission as if you were actually distributing your game.
			The maximum file size for a submission is 256MB. Make sure that all your content fits to this.
			Make sure that you have compiled your submitted binary in Release mode.
			Include any necessary DLLs.
			Make sure that your binary actually runs on Cylon/Hal at our institute.
			Make sure that the executable in your submission is directly startable (content and dlls are already in the right places)
			Make sure that you pushed your last changes to your repository, since this get tagged when you upload your submission

			When you have gathered all necessary files, compress them all in one ZIP archive together with the documentation pdf (see below) and name it "executable1-[groupname]" where [groupname] has to be replaced by your games title. Your submission has to contain at least the following files and folders. If files are not included in the folders they should be, the submission will not be graded.

		[ ]	bin/
				A binary directory containing your EXE file.
				Put content files needed for your game into a subfolder of bin.
		[ ]	doc/
				A documentation directory with a PDF file documenting the controls, development status and effects of your game
		[x]	readme.txt
				A text-file containing your group name and you names, Matrikelnummer and Kennzahl. In addition you should state on which graphics card (AMD/NVIDIA) you have tested your solution.
		-----------------------------------
		---------- Documentation ----------

		[X] Brief description of the implementation, in particular a short description of how the different aspects of the requirements (see above) were implemented.
		[X] �Features� of the game.
		[X] How and which objects were illuminated (description of light sources) or textured.
		[X] What additional libraries (eg for collision, object-loader, sound, �) were used, including references (URL) (see restrictions)?

---------- 2nd Talk ----------
[ ] Upload on 1.6
[ ] Highly possible on 2.6
[ ] Test before at Uni-Rechner
-----------------------------------
---------- 2nd Submission ----------
	---------- Grading Schema ----------
		[ ] Gameplay
		[ ] Effects �> Effect-List
		[ ] Animated Objects
			 Your game should also contain non-convex objects, objects with a curved surface (surfaces where Gouraud Shading simulates the curving)
			 In contrast to the 1st submission, where the objects only had to move, the objects in your game have to be animated in this submission. You have to implement at least hierarchical animations. For example: a spinning head on a moving body, where the head and the body are separate meshes. You can of course can use any other technique (Skeletal Animation etc).
		[ ] Frustum Culling
			It is necessary for this submission to implement some kind of View-Frustum-Culling (Object-Boundingboxes, Bounding-Spheres,..). The reason for this is to increase the performance, which should be displayed in the debug-outputs (see below for more info).
		[ ] Controls
				[x] F1 - Help (if available)
				[x] F2 - Frame Time on/off
				[x] F3 - Wire Frame on/off
				[ ] F4 - Textur-Sampling-Quality: Nearest Neighbor/Bilinear
				[ ] F5 - Mip Mapping-Quality: Off/Nearest Neighbor/Linear
				[ ] F6 - Enable/Disable effect (if necessary, see Effects)
				[ ] F7 - Enable/Disable effect (if necessary, see Effects)
				[x] F8 - Viewfrustum-Culling on/off
				[ ] F9 - Blending on/off
		[ ] Experimenting with OpenGL (Blending, Texture Sampling, MipMapping Quality)
				This means, that advanced functionality of OpenGL should be implement and tested. Those functionalities are:
				[ ]Buffer-Objects: FBO (Frame Buffer Object) or UBO (Uniform Buffer Object)
				[ ]Blending: Use hardware blending (glBlend*) somewhere in your code. Make sure it can be toggled on/off
				[ ]Mip Mapping (on/off)
				[ ]Textur-Sampling-Quality (Bi/Trilinear Filtering)
